Clojure bundled with a lot of handy "shell scripting" libs. Put the
uberjar on your classpath and you can have lots of handy functionality
for shell-scripting, or whatever.

* Status

Not finished at all. Well, you can generate the uberjar, but the
"cluj" script it's something you can download and have it install the
components needed.

* Bundled Libs

All of these are mashed together into an uberjar, the "main" of which
is the Clojure REPL.

 - [[http://clojure.org][clojure]] :: The language
 - [[https://github.com/clojure/core.async][core.async]] :: Async-style concurrency
 - [[http://www.http-kit.org][http-kit]] :: (has both server and client)
 - [[https://github.com/clojure/tools.cli][tools.cli]] :: Command line options.
 - [[https://github.com/Raynes/fs/][fs]] :: This library defines some utilities for working with the file
         system in Clojure. Mostly, it wants to fill the gap that
         =clojure.java.io= leaves and add on (and prettify) what
         =java.io.File= provides.
 - [[https://github.com/clojure/data.json][data.json]] :: JSON parser/generator to/from Clojure data structures.
 - [[https://github.com/xsc/pandect][pandect]] :: Pandect is a fast and easy-to-use Message Digest,
              Checksum, HMAC and Signature library for Clojure.
 - [[https://github.com/cemerick/pomegranate][pomegranate]] :: Support for resolving Java/Clojure dependencies same
                  as Leiningen.

* Example Script

Imagine you want to use shell script to build your Clojure app rather
than a full blown system. The hardest part of that system is resolving
dependencies. =Cluj= includes =pomegranate=, so you can role your own
resolver:

#+begin_src clojure
  #!/usr/bin/env cluj

  (require '[cluj.core :as cluj])
  (require '[clojure.string :as s])
  (require '[cemerick.pomegranate.aether :as a])
  (require '[clojure.pprint :refer (pprint)])

  (def deps
    '[[org.clojure/clojure "1.8.0-RC3"]
      [me.raynes/fs "1.4.6" :excluse [org.clojure/clojure]]
      [http-kit "2.1.19"]])

  (def repos
    {"central" {:url "http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/"}
     "sonatype" {:url "http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases"}
     "java.net" {:url "http://download.java.net/maven/2"}
     "clojars" {:url "http://clojars.org/repo"}})

  (defn jar-list
    [deps repos]
    (-> (a/resolve-dependencies :coordinates deps :repositories repos)
        (a/dependency-files)))

  (defn class-path
    [deps repos]
    (->> (jar-list deps repos)
         (map #(.getAbsolutePath %))
         (s/join (System/getProperty "path.separator"))))

  ;; Print path to each jar
  (doseq [jar (sort (jar-list deps repos))]
    (println "jar =>" (.getAbsolutePath jar)))

  ;; Dump the classpath
  (println "classpath:")
  (println (class-path deps repos))
#+end_src
